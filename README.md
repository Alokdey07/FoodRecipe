## About Food Recipe Finder

How many times have you found yourself looking for that perfect recipe – only to find that you’re missing one or more ingredients?

How many times have you opened the fridge and thought to yourself -- what can I make ?

How many times have you thrown away an ingredient, because you couldn't figure out how to use it before it expired ?

Unlike other recipe apps, Food Recipe Finder App only shows you recipes that require the ingredients you already have.

All the recipes you see on Food Recipe Finder App are recipes you can make right now. No more inconvenient grocery runs for a missing ingredient, at a time when you should be home, with your family and friends
